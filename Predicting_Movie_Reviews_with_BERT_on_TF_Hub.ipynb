    "If you’ve been following Natural Language Processing over the past year, you’ve probably heard of BERT: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. It’s a neural network architecture designed by Google researchers that’s totally transformed what’s state-of-the-art for NLP tasks, like text classification, translation, summarization, and question answering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that BERT's been added to [TF Hub](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub) as a loadable module, it's easy(ish) to add into existing Tensorflow text pipelines. In an existing pipeline, BERT can replace text embedding layers like ELMO and GloVE. Alternatively, [finetuning](http://wiki.fast.ai/index.php/Fine_tuning) BERT can provide both an accuracy boost and faster training time in many cases.\n",

Some code was adapted from [this colab notebook](https://colab.sandbox.google.com/github/tensorflow/tpu/blob/master/tools/colab/bert_finetuning_with_cloud_tpus.ipynb). Let's get started!"

With the recent \\nstrong  performance  in  semiconductors  (SOX  +1.3%  and  +22.1%  last \\nweek  and  YTD vs.  S&P +1% and  +13%, respectively) we have begun \\nto  receive  increasing  investor  questions  on  the  set-up  into  1Q19 \\nearnings  season.   On  a  near-term  overall  basis,  we  think  some  profit \\ntaking  in  semis  could  materialize  as  a  more  cautious  stance  on  1Q19 \\nearnings  season  materializes  -  most  investors  we  have  spoken  with \\nexpect choppy / weak 1Q19 results and cautious 2Q19 outlooks;  hope \\nof  a  materializing  2H2019  recovery  remains  key  focus.   That  said,  we \\nthink  it  is  becoming  increasingly  important  to  consider  company-\\nspecific dynamics  – we continue to highlight:  (1) AMD: Shares rallied \\nlast week (+15%) on Google’s Stadia (Project Stream) game streaming \\nannouncement  confirming  the  use  of  AMD’s  Radeon  GPUs  (a  4Q18 \\ndriver)  and  CPUs  –  implied  use  of  AMD’s  7nm  Rome  EPYC  CPUs \\nconsidered  to  be  new  news.  We  remain  positive  on  AMD’s  positioning \\nfor  datacenter  momentum  into  mid/2H2019  (note:  we  think  some \\nRome  shipments  could  commence  in  2Q19),  coupled  with  continued \\nbroadening PC adoption of AMD’s Ryzen processors through 2019.  (2) \\nNVIDIA:  NVIDIA  shares  were  up  5.5%  this  week  (+34%  YTD)  as  we \\ncontinue  to  see  increasing  evidence  of  a  completed  gaming  channel \\ninventory burn-through, coupled positive comments on NVIDIA’s Turing \\nRTX  ramp  following  full  product  suite  availability  commencing  in  late-\\nJanuary.  We  also  remain  positive  on  NVIDIA’s  reacceleration  of \\ndatacenter  growth  into  2H2019  and  the  strategic  merits  /  accretion \\nfrom the company’s acquisition of Mellanox. \\n\\uf0b7  Weak  South  Korea  Trade  Data:  (1)  NAND.  Exports  of  NAND  Flash \\non a US$ basis in South Korea declined 41% y/y in Feb.; -34% y/y for \\nJan + Feb. Unit exports were -8% y/y in Jan + Feb.

Key highlights include:  \\n \\n\\uf0b7  DRAMeXchange expects overall DRAM prices to fall approximately 20% q/q in 1Q19 (no surprise). 2Q19 \\nand 3Q19 prices are estimated to decline by 15%-20% and ~10% q/q, respectively. \\n\\uf0b7  This  includes  server  DRAM prices  estimated  to  decline  by 20%  q/q  and  ~10%  q/q  in 2Q19  and 3Q19, \\nrespectively; PC DRAM prices estimated to decline at a similar rate.  eMCP pricing or mobile devices are \\nestimated  to  decline  by  10%-20%  q/q  in  2Q19  and  5%-10%  q/q  in  2Q190  and  3Q19,  respectively; \\ndiscrete mobile DRAM prices are expected to decline by 5%-10% q/q in both 2Q19 and 3Q19. \\n\\uf0b7  DRAMeXchange  estimates  that  inventory  levels  for  DRAM  suppliers  have  increased  to  over  6  weeks \\n(note:  Micron  reported  134  days  of  total  inventory  on  a  dollar  basis  exiting  their  February  quarter).  \\nServer & PC customers were noted to be sitting on over 7 weeks of DRAM inventory.   \\n\\uf0b7  1Ynm  DRAM  is  expected  to  be  a  key  driver  of  continued  bit  supply  growth;  however,  DRAMeXchange \\nalso  notes  that  DRAM  suppliers  are  continuing  to  adopt  large  price  reductions  in  order  to  stimulate \\ndemand.   \\n\\uf0b7  The  write-up  notes  that  DRAM  content  per  box  expansion  is  expected  to  perform  lower  than  what  was \\nseen in 2018 across all product categories.  \\n\\uf0b7  DRAMeXchange notes that a few N. American hyperscale datacenter customers started to return to place \\norders in March.  \\n \\nS. Korea Trade Data: Jan + Feb NAND Exports -34% Y/Y; DRAM Imports + Exports -27% Y/Y  \\nOn a US$ basis, exports of NAND Flash in South Korea declined 41% y/y in February (-10% m/m); down \\n34%  y/y  for  January  +  February.  Imports  of  NAND  Flash  declined  42.5%  y/y  for  January  +  February. \\nFrom a quantity basis, NAND Flash exports are down 5% y/y in February and down 8% y/y in January + \\nFebruary.  Using  the  5  year  average  January  +  February  contribution,  we  would  be  left  to  estimate  total \\nexports down nearly 40% y/y in 1Q19; units down 10% y/y. This would imply average 1Q19 pricing down \\n18% sequentially (-30% y/y).  \\n \\nExports  +  imports  of  DRAM  in  South  Korea  declined  33%  y/y  in  February  (vs.  -21.5%  y/y  in  January);  \\n-27% y/y for January + February. Exports of DRAM decreased 37.5% y/y for January + February. From a \\nquantity basis, DRAM exports + imports are  -22% y/y in February and -20% y/y in January + February. \\nUsing  the 5 year  average  January  + February  contribution,  we would be  left  to  estimate  total exports + \\nimports down nearly 30% y/y in 1Q19; units down 22% y/y. While mix should be considered, this would \\nimply average 1Q19 pricing down 17% sequentially (-9% y/y). \\n \\n \\n \\n2 | Wells Fargo Securities, LLC \\n \\nWells Fargo Technology Weekly \\n \\nEquity Research \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC | 3 \\nIT Hardware & Communications Networking \\nEquity Research \\nNAND Spot Pricing: TLC Composite Down 0.6%, 256Gb and 512Gb Down 1.5% and 3.2% \\n\\uf0b7  NAND  spot  pricing  indicated  that  tracked  TLC  was  down  an  average  of  0.6%  w/w  following  a  0.6% \\ndecrease  last  week.  The  decline  was  led  by  128Gb  TLC  that  was  down  1.3%  while  256Gb  and  512Gb \\nTLC, not yet included in our composite, were down 1.5% and 3.2%, respectively.

Inspectrum noted that inquiries were limited during the week \\nand the market was sluggish. 8Gb DDR4 (not included in the composite) was down 2.9% w/w while 8Gb \\nDDR4 WB was down 1.7%.   \\n \\n\\uf0b7  For 1Q19, overall DRAM spot pricing is now down 12.3% sequentially and 28.1% y/y following a 12.6% \\nsequential decline in 4Q18. High capacity DDR4 4Gb 512Mx8 is down 11.6% sequentially and 40.2% y/y \\nthus far in the quarter.  \\n \\n4 | Wells Fargo Securities, LLC \\n \\nWells Fargo Technology Weekly \\n \\nEquity Research \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nDigiTimes Article Highlights SSD Demand Elasticity via Declining NAND Flash Pricing \\nDigiTimes this week published an article highlighting the expectation of increasing enterprise SSD demand \\nelasticity amid continued declines in NAND Flash pricing. The article notes that SSD providers are pushing \\n16TB  capacities  (e.g.,  Silicon  Motion,  or  SIMO’s,  pushing  of  new  enterprise  SSD  controllers  supporting \\n16TB  of  capacity;  volume  shipments  commencing  in  2H2019).  In  addition  to  pricing  dynamics,  we \\ncontinue to believe the adoption of NVMe in the enterprise market opens up the system architectures to \\nincorporate / adopt higher NAND Flash capacity density.  The article (along with our industry checks) have \\nincreasingly  pointed  to  increasing  adoption  of 512GB client  SSD  capacities  over  the  past  several  months \\nas  price  points  have  declined  to  levels  of  256GB  SSDs  (note:  industry  estimates  show  ~260-280GB \\naverage capacity for client SSDs in the most recent quarter).   \\n \\nIn terms of NAND Flash technology, the article reports that NAND Flash vendors are now realizing 90%+ \\nyield levels on 64-Layer 3D NAND and are increasingly focused on moving to 96-Layer 3D NAND. Western \\nDigital  has  noted  that  it  expects  96-Layer  3D  NAND  production  cost  crossover  to  be  achieved  in  the \\ncurrent quarter; bit production crossover targeted for C4Q19.  Micron this week also positively highlighted \\npositive traction in 96-Layer 3D NAND; however, the company also noted that it would not meaningfully \\ncommercialize its next-generation 3D NAND (likely 128-Layer) given the cost structure increase attributed \\nto the move to replacement (charge) trap technology vs. Micron’s thus far use of floating gate.   \\n \\nDigiTimes,  referencing  DRAMeXchange,  notes  that  NAND Flash  contract  prices continue  to  fall;  however, \\nthe  rate  of  declines  are  moderating  in  2Q19  versus  the  -20%  q/q  decline  in  1Q19.   Like  our  recent \\nmeeting with Western Digital management, the article notes that NAND prices are expected to continue to \\nmoderate into 2H2019 as vendors realize moderating output levels into mid/2H2019.   \\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC | 5 \\nIT Hardware & Communications Networking \\nEquity Research \\n \\nDigiTimes Highlights Increasing PCIe (NVMe) SSD Adoption \\nIn addition to the aforementioned thoughts on NAND Flash pricing and demand elasticity trends, DigiTimes \\nalso published an article discussing the increasing adoption of PCIe (NVMe) SSDs.  A few of the key points \\ninclude:  \\n \\n\\uf0b7  Based on industry sources, global shipments of SSDs are expected to increase 20%-25% y/y in 2019.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7  PCIe  (NVMe)  SSDs  are  expected  to  account  for  ~50%  of  total  shipments  –  including  both  client  and \\nenterprise.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7  512GB  PCIe  client  SSD  prices  have  declined  11%  q/q  to  $55  in  1Q19,  which  compares  to  a  9%  q/q \\ndecline in SATA SSD prices – resulting in an ongoing narrowing of the price delta from the ~30% level \\nseen in 2018. \\n \\n\\uf0b7  Avg. unit prices for 512GB capacities have declined to levels comparable with 256GB SSDs a year ago; \\nlarger price declines are expected in the 512GB to 1TB capacity points through 2019 – i.e., bit demand \\nelasticity. \\n \\n\\uf0b7  The industry is seeing accelerating adoption of PCIe Gen 3.0 SSDs in the notebook market.  \\n \\n \\nThe  Next  Platform  Discussion  on  Hyperscale  Datacenter  Architecture  Trends  –  Interview  with \\nMicrosoft GM of Azure, Kashagra Vaid \\n \\nArticle  Link:  https://www.nextplatform.com/2019/03/20/on-the-hot-seat-in-the-hyperscale-\\ndatacenter/  \\n \\nThe  Next  Platform  published  an  interesting  and  insightful  article  following  an  interview  with  Microsoft \\nDistinguished Engineer & General Manager of Microsoft Azure, Kushagra Vaid.  The discussion touches on \\nMicrosoft’s adoption of OCP based servers (Project Olympus), views on the evolution toward specialized / \\npurpose-built  silicon,  thoughts  on  the  cooling  as  an  increasingly  significant  challenge  in  hyperscale  data \\ncenters,  and  the  need  to  move  to  silicon  photonics.    Below  we  summarize  some  of  the  interesting \\ntakeaways:  \\n \\n\\uf0b7  Mr.  Vaid  noted  that  the  huge  majority  (+90%)  of  the  hardware  Microsoft  purchases  is  based  on  the \\ncompany’s Open Compute specifications.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7  Four  and  eight-socket  servers  for  hierarchical  storage  are  not  currently  covered  by  the  OCP \\nspecifications.  These  systems  require  head  nodes  with  Fiber  Channel  (FC)  connectivity,  as  well  as \\ninterface with tape subsystems for data retention. \\n \\n\\uf0b7  The  article  highlighted  the  broad  adoption  of  configurations  based  on  Microsoft’s  Project  Olympus \\nreference specifications.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7  Microsoft  places  a  Cerberus  security  chip  on  every  motherboard,  which  provides  scalability  across  a \\nbroad-based supply chain.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7  All new server capacity being deployed in Azure is using Project Olympus servers; noting that it takes a \\nwhile to decommission the servers the company has previously deployed from HP Enterprise and Dell.   \\n \\n\\uf0b7  Microsoft  is  collaborating  with  Facebook  on  the  new  OCP  Accelerator  Modules  (OAM)  as  part  of  the \\ncompany’s Zion server design.  The article notes that this could allow Microsoft and Facebook to deploy \\na chassis with 16 GPUs versus eight GPUs.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7  Cambrian Explosion: The Next Platform notes that we are in a Cambrian explosion of computing, while \\nalso highlighting that Microsoft has an effort to have up to half of their computing done on Arm-based \\nCPUs. In response, Mr. Vaid points out that Arm CPUs are multithreaded and work very well for certain \\ntypes  of  workloads;  x86  CPUs  are  better  suited  for  single-threaded  performance  –  the  datacenter  is \\nbecoming more heterogeneous.   \\n \\n\\uf0b7  Mr.  Vaid  endorsed  the  view  that  we  are  moving  to  more  purpose-built  silicon  requirements  given  the \\nslowdown  in  Moore’s  Law.  He  noted  the  view  that  if  the  economic  value  justifies  the  need  for \\nspecialization  for  certain  workloads  than  the  industry  (and  Microsoft)  will  focus  on  this  architectural \\nneed.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7  When asked about the positioning of startups focusing on specialized silicon development, Mr. Vaid it is \\nstill too early to tell how it plays out – none of them are in volume production yet.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7  The article notes that power consumption continues to be an increasingly important factor  – CPUs now \\nrequire  +200  Watts  of  power  consumption.  Power  density  increases  also  coincides  /  drives  increasing \\nneeds for cooling – no one can move enough air to cool their infrastructure.  Mr. Vaid noted that cooling \\nis going to be a big issue to overcome over the next 2-3 years.   \\n \\n\\uf0b7  Alternative cooling techniques could include immersive liquid cooling, or heat / cold plates – noting that \\nthe  latter  solution  could be more  attractive  as  it would  not require  radical  changes  in the  data  center. \\n6 | Wells Fargo Securities, LLC \\n \\nWells Fargo Technology Weekly \\n \\nEquity Research \\nThis is going to be a necessity given the deployment of AI silicon across the data center. We think this is \\nwhy  most  of  the  next-generation  silicon  providers  have  emphasized  competitive  benchmarks  around \\nTOPS per Watt (TOPS/W).   \\n \\n\\uf0b7  Cooling challenges have resulted in racks within a datacenter to be underutilized – i.e., unable to fill to \\nfull  capacity  given  that  open  space  is  required  for  air  based  cooling.  The  article  also  notes  that  this \\nresults in stranded / unused ports for top-of-rack switches.   \\n \\n\\uf0b7  Mr. Vaid notes: “Today, the sweet spot is between 10 kilowatts and 15 kilowatts, based on commodity \\nparts with air cooling. You can probably go up to 25 kilowatts or so, and sort of be alright, but now you \\nneed more  copper  and  that  cost  starts going  up.  Beyond  that,  I  don’t  think  the  industry  has  solutions \\nthat are available at a broader level  – excepting supercomputers and other exotic equipment.”   In our \\nopinion, this is an interesting comment as it relates to Cray, which architecturally provided high-density \\nsupercomputers and has Microsoft as a customer.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7  From a networking perspective, Mr. Vaid highlighted the industry need to move to optical versus copper, \\nincluding silicon photonics / integrated optics as the industry moves beyond 100G.   \\n \\n \\n4Q18 Data Center Ethernet Switch Market Review: ODM / Direct Gain Revenue Share in 100Gb \\nas $/Port Declines Moderate; Strong Cisco Campus Growth at +24% Y/Y \\nWhile backward looking, this week we received IDC’s 4Q18 updated data center Ethernet switching data. \\nIn addition to Ethernet shipments by market vertical, below we illustrate IDC’s Ethernet data center ports \\nshipped and revenue market share estimates by speed for 4Q18. \\n \\n\\uf0b7  Data Center Switching Vertical Breakdown: IDC provides a breakdown of port shipments / revenue \\nby vertical – continuing to highlight the proliferation of cloud data center.  \\n \\n \\n \\n\\uf0d8 Cloud  Data  Center:  According  to  IDC  data,  cloud  data  center  switching  revenue  reached  $1.57 \\nbillion in 4Q18 (+18.5% y/y) and was +9.5% sequentially. As illustrated below, Arista held a 22.2% \\nmarket share in 4Q18, up from 19.6% a year ago, while Cisco held a 37.2% share (vs. 39.9% a year \\nago).  Juniper’s  cloud  data  center  market  share  stood  at  5.7%  during  the  December  quarter, \\ncompared  to  6.1%  and  7.1%  in  the  prior  and  year  ago  quarters,  respectively.  We  would  note \\ncollective ODM Direct / whitebox revenue recorded strong growth of 39.3% y/y in 4Q18 (vs. +21.3% \\ny/y  in  3Q18)  –  revenue  share  at 17.6% vs. 16.1%  in  3Q18.  Accton  /  EdgeCore continues  to be  the \\nleading ODM at $168M of revenue in 4Q18 (+52% y/y).  \\n\\uf0d8 Communication Service  Provider:  Data  Center SP revenue  of $321  million  in  4Q18 was  up 2.7% \\ny/y. This follows +7%, +10%, +4%, and 3% y/y in 4Q17, 1Q18, 2Q18, and 3Q18, respectively. Cisco \\nheld  a  70%  share  in  the  December  quarter,  down  from  73%  in  the  prior  and  year  ago  quarters. \\nArista’s  share  remained  unchanged  q/q  at  7.8%  and  compared  to  5.2%  a  year  ago.  Arista’s  SP \\nrevenue  has  increased  78%  y/y  over  the  trailing  12  months  –  growing  from  $50M  to  $89M.  While \\nmore  volatile  on  a  quarterly  basis,  we  would  also  highlight  Huawei’s  share  now  standing  at  15%  in \\n4Q18, compared to 11.5% and 15% in the prior and year ago quarters.  \\n \\n\\uf0d8 Enterprise: Enterprise data center switching revenue of $1.49 billion was down 1.4% y/y, compared \\nto  +6.5%,  +12%,  +3.5%,  and  3.1%  y/y  in  4Q17,  1Q18,  2Q18,  and  3Q18,  respectively.  Cisco’s \\nmarket leading share declined to 53.4% in 4Q18, compared to 55.1% in the September 2018 quarter \\n(vs. 56% a year ago). Arista’s share declined sequentially to 8.4% in 4Q18, which compares to 9.1% \\nand  8.4%  in  the  prior  and  year  ago  quarters.  HPE/H3C’s  share  increased  to  10.7%,  compared  to \\n10.1%  and  8.9%  in  the  prior  and  year  ago  periods,  while  Huawei  is  estimated  at  11.8%  share,  vs. \\n9.1% and 11.8% in the prior and year ago periods, respectively. \\n\\uf0b7  100G  Data  Center  Revenue  +3%  q/q  vs.  +20%  in  3Q18;  ODM  /  Direct  Gain  Share;  Cisco  / \\nArista  Battle  for  #1:  IDC  reported  approximately  3.8  million  100Gb  ports  were  shipped  in  4Q18 \\n(+136% y/y); revenue of $1.08 billion was up 68% y/y and 3% sequentially (vs. +20% q/q in 3Q18). \\nArista  recaptured  100Gb  revenue  share  in  the  quarter  from  Cisco,  although  both  companies  remain \\nwithin  a  percent  of  each  other.  Arista’s  share  now  stands  at  31.6%,  compared  to  a  record  36.5%  in \\n1Q18  and  30.6%  in  the  prior  quarter;  with  port  shipment  share  roughly  flat  sequentially  at  24.1%, \\ncompared  to  23.6%  in  the  year  ago period. Cisco’s  revenue  share  stood  at  31.4%, down  from 33.2% \\nand 37% in the prior and year ago periods; port share at 15.6% vs. 18.6% in 3Q18 and 20.9% a year \\nago. Juniper’s port ship share stood at  3.3%, compared to  3.7% a year ago (2.6% in 3Q18); revenue \\nshare was down for the third quarter in a row  at 3.7%, and compared to 5.6% a year ago. We would \\nnote that HPE’s China joint venture (H3C) lost revenue share in the December quarter and now stands \\nat 1.2% (down from 4.5% last quarter), while Huawei increased its share to 7.3% vs. 4.8% in 3Q18. \\n \\nODM / Direct port ship market share continues to climb – now standing at 48.6% in 4Q18, compared to \\n42.7% a year ago. ODM / Direct revenue share rose to an all-time high of 18.3%, which compares to \\n15% a year ago. Within this, we would note that Accton / EdgeCore held a 13% and 35% revenue and \\nports  shipped  market  share.  We  think  it  is  important  to  consider  the  significant  discount  on  a  $/port \\nbasis offered  by ODM  /direct  –  standing  at  approximately $108  in  4Q18  (vs. $142  a year  ago),  which \\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC | 7 \\nIT Hardware & Communications Networking \\nEquity Research \\ncompares  to  Cisco  and  Arista  at  $577  and  $377,  respectively.  We  would  highlight  that  Cisco’s  $/Port \\nincreased 7% sequentially, while Arista’s was relatively flat and Juniper saw a 30% q/q decline. ODM / \\nDirect $/Port saw declines moderate in the quarter at -2% q/q vs. -7% q/q in both 2Q18 and 3Q18. \\n \\n\\uf0b7  Cisco Campus Switching Revenue +23%  Y/y Driven by Catalyst 9000 Adoption: In addition to \\nour analysis of the data center switching market, we would highlight IDC data indicates Cisco’s campus \\nswitching business  increased  23%  y/y  in  4Q18,  compared to  -4%,  +6%,  -5%,  and +8% y/y  in 4Q17, \\n1Q18, 2Q18, and 3Q18 respectively. This compares to total campus switching revenue growing 17% y/y \\nin  4Q18  (vs.  +6%  and  -4%  in  the  prior  and  year  ago  quarters,  respectively)  –  Cisco’s  revenue  share \\nstands  at  58%,  relatively  flat  from  the  prior  quarter  (vs.  55%  a  year  ago).  We  continue  to  focus  on \\nCisco’s Catalyst 9000 campus product refresh (introduced in July 2017) as the company reported double \\ndigit growth in campus switching driven by the Cat 9k product cycle in F2Q19. We would also highlight \\nHPE’s revenue share gains in campus switching during the quarter – growing to 9.2% vs. 8.7% share in \\n3Q18. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n8 | Wells Fargo Securities, LLC \\n \\nWells Fargo Technology Weekly \\n \\nEquity Research \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC | 9 \\nIT Hardware & Communications Networking \\nEquity Research \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n10 | Wells Fargo Securities, LLC \\n \\nWells Fargo Technology Weekly \\n \\nEquity Research \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC | 11 \\nIT Hardware & Communications Networking \\nEquity Research \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n12 | Wells Fargo Securities, LLC \\n \\nWells Fargo Technology Weekly \\n \\nEquity Research \\n \\nIDC External Storage Forecast Continues to Call for -1% 2019; AFA +11% CAGR Thru 2023 \\nLast  week  IDC  published  its  updated  (1Q19)  storage  forecast  –  increasing  the  firm’s  2019  revenue \\nestimate  for  external  storage  by  an  additional  4%  following  a  3%  increase  in  December.

While we are  not changing our forward \\nestimates  (note:  NVIDIA’s  Investor  Days  have  not  historically  provided  any  forward-looking  financial \\nmodel  targets  /  commentary),  and  we  can  appreciate  the  fact  that  NVIDIA  shares  are  not  cheap  (26x \\nP/E  and  21x  EV/EBITDA  on  our  C2020  estimates),  we  think  the  company  provided  what  should  be \\nviewed  as  a  positive  review  of  its  domain-focused  platform  positioning  and  improved  fundamental \\ndrivers  looking  forward.  A  few  of  the  most  notable  takeaways,  in  our  opinion,  include:  (1)  Positive \\nRTX  upgrade  cycle  commentary  –  With  a  reiteration  that  expects  a  return  to  normalized  gaming \\ninventory  exiting  F1Q20,  coupled  with  the  Turing  portfolio  availability  (entry  to  high-end),  NVIDIA \\npositively disclosed that Turing RTX has seen a 45% higher sell-thru vs. Pascal at this point in product \\ncycle  (~8  weeks  sell-thru  at  $299+  price  points);  ~48%  of  installed  base  at  pre-Pascal  GPUs.  (2) \\nGeForce NOW Alliance = NVIDIA Revenue Sharing Opportunity for Game Streaming (5G Play) \\n– NVIDIA GeForce NOW Alliance is a cloud-based game streaming partnership opportunity with service \\nproviders and a NVIDIA revenue sharing model (a 5G play). NVIDIA announced initial partnerships with \\nSoftBank  and  LG  U+;  service  availability  expected  in  2H2019.   The  company  believes  it  can  have  at \\nleast  one partner  in  each  country.   (3)  Datacenter –  no big  surprises  /  model  update  drivers,  in  our \\nopinion; NVIDIA outlined a datacenter TAM expanding from ~$37B in 2018 to estimated $50B by 2023.  \\nThe  company  also  emphasized  its  datacenter  CUDA  ecosystem  expansion  (1.2M  developers,  600+ \\naccelerated apps, etc.).   \\n \\n\\uf0b7  DATA  CENTER:  $50B  TAM  by  2023.  NVIDIA  provided  a  positive  overview  of  the  company’s  data \\ncenter  opportunity  with  the  company  estimating  an  addressable  opportunity  of  ~$50  billion  by  2023. \\nNVIDIA pointed to continued strong growth in hyperscale AI training workload requirements – continued \\nupward  trend  in  petaflops  /  day  with  a  continued  expansion  in  datasets.  More  importantly,  NVIDIA \\nbelieves  it  is  at  the  early  stages  of  accelerating  adoption  for  AI  Inferencing  (a  continued  key  topic  of \\ndebate among investors, in our opinion), incrementally reporting that in F2019 the company had a  few \\nhundreds  of  millions  of  AI  inferencing  revenue.  In  enterprise,  NVIDIA  disclosed  that  it  has  seen  3.5x \\nDGX revenue growth y/y for deep learning; 1,000+ DGX customer deployments. \\n \\n\\uf0b7  GAMING: NVIDIA highlighted that its Turing gaming GPUs are off to a positive start (Sell-thru of $299+ \\nTuring  GPUs  are  45%  higher  than  Pascal  ~8  wks.  post  launch)  and  reiterated  its  confidence  in  Ray \\nTracing with roughly a dozen of games supporting RTX expected in 2019; focus on acceleration driven \\nby  expanding  support  from  numerous  game  engines  (notably  Unreal  &  Unity).  The  company  remains \\nconfident  in  secular  gaming  trends,  including  eSports  momentum  (moving  toward  500M+  gamers;  up \\nfrom 280M in 2016 and ~400M in 2018), and growth in casual gamers who start at a younger age and \\ncontinue  gaming  longer  into  their  lives.  NVIDIA  noted  that  the  crypto  inventory  flush  is  on  track  and \\ncontinues to expect normalization exiting F1Q20. \\n \\nPlease see our detailed report published on 3/18/19 for additional information. \\n \\nJensen Huang (CEO) Keynote @ GTC - Quick Notes / Thoughts \\n\\uf0b7  WELLS’  CALL:  We  attended  Jensen  Huang’s,  (NVIDIA  Founder  &  CEO),  keynote  presentation  at  GTC. \\nMr.  Huang,  as  expected,  positively  highlighted  NVIDIA’s  competitive  differentiation  /  ecosystem \\nexpansion  (i.e.,  its  more  than  just  chip  development).  With  a  positive view on  NVIDIA’s  acquisition  of \\nMellanox (deepening datacenter strategy / synergies), we increase our price target to $190 (was $170). \\nIn  terms  of  announcements,  we  would  highlight:  (1)  New  Data  Science  Server;  No  Updates  to \\nDGX-2:  NVIDIA  introduced  a  new  Data  Science  Server  positioned  toward  hyperscale  (scale-out) \\narchitectural approaches for data science.

This  comes  sixteen  months  after  the  company  commenced  mass  production  of  the \\ncompany’s  2nd  generation  10nm  (1Ynm)  8Gb  DDR4  solutions.    Samsung  reports  that  it  was  able  to \\ndevelop 1Znm 8Gb DDR4 without the use of Extreme Ultra-Violet (EUV) processing.   Samsung points out \\nthat  this  represents  the  industry’s  smallest  memory  process  node  and  is  positioned  to  cost  effectively \\nmeet demand for new DDR4 DRAM with +20% higher manufacturing productivity compared to the 1Ynm \\nDRAM.  Samsung  will  commence  mass  production  of  1Znm  8Gb  DDR4  solutions  in  2H2029  to \\naccommodate enterprise servers and high-end PC demand to be launched in 2020. \\n \\nSamsung’s  announcement  notes  that  1Znm  DRAM  will  pave  the  roadmap  toward  DDR5,  LPDDR5,  and \\nGDDR6  solutions;  subsequent  versions  of  1Znm  DRAM  solutions  will  drive  increased  capacities  and \\nperformance.  Samsung  states  that  it  plans  to  increase  the  portion  of  its  main  memory  production  in  its \\nPyeongtaek  fab  to  meet  rising  demand  for  next-generation  DRAM  solutions.    As  a  reminder,  Micron  had \\nreported  this  week  that  it  was  seeing  good  yields  on  their  1Ynm  DRAM  with  an  expected  conversion  to \\nmaterialize  over  the  coming  quarters.    The  company  also  noted  that  it  has  make  excellent  progress  in \\n1Znm DRAM with initial sample product shipments commencing.  \\n \\n \\nIntel \\n \\n \\n(INTC – $53.52 – Outperform) \\n \\n \\n** Intel Will Be Hosting Data-Centric Product Launch Event on April 2nd in San Francisco** \\n \\nHPCWire Interview with Jim Keller, Intel’s head of Silicon Engineering Group \\n \\nArticle Link: https://www.hpcwire.com/2019/03/21/interview-with-2019-person-to-watch-jim-keller/ \\n \\nHPCWire  published  an  interesting  piece  summarizing  a  recent  interview  of  Intel’s  Head  of  Silicon \\nEngineering  Group,  Jim  Keller.    Mr.  Keller  has  been  at  Intel  for  the  past  year  and  interestingly  he \\npreviously was a key developer for AMD’s Zen architecture, prior to joining Tesla.  Some of the takeaways \\nfrom the interview include:  \\n \\n\\uf0b7  Mr. Keller noted that Intel’s scale was one of the reasons he joined the company; the ability to leverage \\nhis knowledge across a broadening range of applications.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7  Thoughts  on  a  slowing  Moore’s  Law  –  Mr.  Keller  stated  that  he  is  not  concerned  about  Moore’s  Law \\nslowing as Intel will elaborate its strategy to continue to drive performance enhancements overtime.   \\n \\n\\uf0b7  Mr. Keller highlighted the evolution of Bell’s Law – transistor density yields computational intensity.  He \\nnotes  that  the  industry  is  now  moving  from  scalar  computing  to  vector  to  matrix  to  spatial-based \\ncomputing;  each  of  these  steps  have  been  quantum  leaps  in  the  use  of  transistors  for  increasingly \\ncomplicated computational models.     \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nAdvanced Micro Devices \\n \\n \\n(AMD – $26.74 – Outperform) \\n \\n \\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC | 25 \\nIT Hardware & Communications Networking \\nEquity Research \\nGoogle Stadia (Project Stream; Game Streaming); Positive Confirmation on Usage of AMD GPUs \\nand CPUs \\nEarlier  this  week,  at  the  Game  Developers  Conference,  Google  introduced  its  new  (albeit  anticipated) \\ngame streaming services called  Stadia (codenamed:  Project Stream). Shares of AMD went higher as this \\nevent  provided  further  confirmation  /  confidence  in  AMD’s  positioning  at  Google  for  the  new  game \\nstreaming services – i.e., Google utilizing AMD’s Radeon Pro CPUs and next-generation CPUs (7nm Rome \\nEPYC CPUs).  Google highlighted Stadia as a centralized community for gamers, creators, and developers \\nwith initial demonstrations running at 60fps at 4K with HDR and surround sound; 120fps support at 8K is \\nplanned.  The service leverages Google’s datacenter footprint (7,500+ edge nodes) with content delivery \\nnetworks  supporting  enough  low  latency  data  transfer  to  support  the  frame  rates  required  for  gaming.   \\nThe end user can play on PCs, smart TVs, tablets, or phones.  Google will offer a custom Wi-Fi connected \\ncontroller  and  integrates  savings  capabilities  into  YouTube.    The  controller  also  includes  an  integrated \\nmicrophone for Google Assistant integration.   Google noted that  Stadia development has been going on \\nfor  years.      Google  plans  to  launch  Stadia  in  2019  in  the  U.S.,  Canada,  and  most  of  Europe.    Pricing  is \\nexpected to be announced in the summer of 2019.  \\n \\nFrom an AMD GPU / CPU perspective, AMD highlighted the GPU supporting 10.7 teraflops of performance \\nwith  56  compute  units  and  HBM2  (high-bandwidth  memory).  The  CPU  was  noted  as  a  custom  x86 \\nprocessor running at 2.7GHz with AVX2 support.   \\n \\n \\nBroadcom \\n \\n(AVGO – $292.98 – Market Perform) \\n \\n \\nBroadcom Intros New Automotive Multilayer Ethernet Switches \\nThis  week  Broadcom  announced  the  introduction  of  its  BCM8956X  family  of  automotive  multilayer \\nEthernet switches, which are targeted at addressing the growing need for bandwidth, flexibility, security, \\nand time-sensitive networking (TSN) for autonomous and connected vehicles. Broadcom highlighted that \\nthe  rapid  adoption  of  in-vehicle  electronics  and  increasing  bandwidth  for  data  intensive  applications  are \\ndriving  the  need  for  Gigabit  Ethernet.  The  BCM8956X  includes  highly-optimized  switches  in  various  port \\nconfigurations  with  integrated  100BASE-T1  and  1000BASE-T1  PHYs  to  enable  cost-effective  designs  for \\nautomotive  gateway,  ADAS  and  infotainment  applications.  The  integrated  PCIe  interface  was  noted  as \\nproviding  high  bandwidth  connectivity  to  the  host  processor,  while  the  on-chip  Layer  3  flow  accelerator \\noffloads  the  host  processor  from  compute  intensive  routing  operations.  Broadcom  is  currently  sampling \\nthe BCM8956X and shipping the BCM8988X to selected automotive OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers. \\n \\n \\nSeagate Technology \\n \\n(STX – $47.57 – Market Perform) \\n \\n \\nSeagate Aligned with HP Enterprise & NVIDIA for AI-Based Manufacturing \\nThis  week  it  was  reported  that  Seagate  is  working  with  HP  Enterprise  and  NVIDIA  to  develop  an  AI-\\ndedicated  platform  codenamed  Project  Athena  that  would  be  implemented  in  Seagate’s  manufacturing.  \\nThe systems would enable a reported 20% reduction in clean room investments and manufacturing times \\nby as much as 10%.  The company would deploy the systems in their manufacturing operations globally.     \\nSeagate  has  reported  that  the  IP  for  the  development  of  the  machines  is  shared  across  the  three \\ncompanies.    It  reports  that  Seagate’s  HDD  manufacturing  operations  involve  ~1,000  different  process \\nsteps; implementing sensors on the systems creates a significant amount of valuable data correction that \\nwill  be  stored  on  the  company’s  edge  cloud  and  utilized  for  enhanced  processes.      As  an  example,  the \\narticle  notes  that  Project  Athena  can  record  several  million  microscopic  images  of  magnetic  heads \\nproduced in the company’s factories each day.    \\n \\n \\nCray \\n \\n(CRAY – $24.95 – Outperform) \\n \\n \\n \\nDepartment of Energy Announces $500M Contract for Cray / Intel Aurora \\nCray  announced  that  the  U.S.  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  would  deploy  the  world’s  first  exascale \\nsupercomputer, the Cray and Intel built Aurora, to be delivered by the end of 2021 (acceptance in 2022) \\nto  the  Argonne  National  Laboratory  (ANL).  The  announcement  valued  the  Aurora’s  contract  at  +$500M \\nwith Cray’s portion valued at upwards of $100M (we would estimate $100- $150M). Cray has highlighted \\nthat this contract is one of the largest in Cray’s history; the second major Shasta win following the NERSC \\nPerlmutter  win  valued  at  $146  million.  Intel  will  serve  as  the  prime  contractor  for  the  system  (i.e., \\nrecognizing revenue for CPUs, next-generation accelerators (GPUs), memory, and cabling. Cray will act as \\na subcontractor providing advanced packaging, its Slingshot interconnect (note: initial Aurora system was \\nslated  to  utilize  Intel’s  Omni-Path  interconnect),  software stack,  and  cabinet  /  cooling  infrastructure.  We \\nexpect  to  see  meaningful  revenue  contribution  from  the  deal  in  the  2022  timeframe.  As  a  reminder, \\nAurora  was  originally  planned  as  a  180  petaflop  pre-exascale  machine  (initial  cost  of  ~$200M)  to  begin \\noperations in 2018, but was reimagined as an exascale machine following the delay of Intel’s  Knights Hill \\nprocessors.  \\n \\nOur  Thoughts  –  Expected,  but  Positive  Validation  of  Cray’s  Positioning  for  Next-Gen \\nSupercomputer  Deployments:  While  the  announcement  of  Cray  and  Intel’s  win  was  expected,  we \\ncontinue  to  be  positive  around  the  company’s  ability  to  compete  for  additional  exascale  machines.  As  a \\n26 | Wells Fargo Securities, LLC \\n \\nWells Fargo Technology Weekly \\n \\nEquity Research \\nreminder, the DOE announced in April 2018 that it planned to acquire up to three exascale systems at a \\ncost  of  up  to  $1.8B  with  a  budget  range  of  $400M  to  $600M  per  system.  The  three  systems  include \\nFrontier, an ORNL system expected to be delivered in 3Q21, El Capitan, expected in 3Q22 at LLNL, and a \\npotential  third  unnamed  exascale  system  at  ANL  dependent  on  funding.  We  think  that  the  Aurora  and \\nPermutter  wins  make  it  more  likely  a  Cray  architecture  is  selected  for  a  CORAL-2  exascale  system.  We \\nwould  also  positively  highlight  the  importance  that  the  Trump  Administration  has  placed  on  exascale \\ncomputing with the administration’s FY2020 DOE budget request asking $809M for exascale computing up \\n27%  from  the  FY2019  request  and  +265%  from  the  FY2016  enacted  budget.  In  addition  to  the  major \\nsupercomputing  funding  and  thus  opportunities,  we  believe  Cray  remains  well  positioned  for  the \\nconvergence between Artificial Intelligence workload requirements and supercomputing architectures.  \\n \\n \\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC | 27 \\nIT Hardware & Communications Networking \\nEquity Research \\n                       Source: U.S. Department of Energy \\n \\n \\nNetApp \\n \\n(NTAP – $67.57 – Market Perform) \\n \\n \\n \\nNetApp Job Listings Update \\nNetApp’s  job  listings  totaled  425,  down  1  from  the  prior  week,  vs.  345  entering  2019.

We remain \\npositive  on  Nutanix’s  technology  differentiation  /  multi-cloud  platform  vision,  which  was  thoroughly \\noutlined  throughout  the  event.  However,  after  providing  disappointing  F3Q19  (Apr  ’19)  guidance  amid  a \\nweakening  forward  pipeline  build  attributed  to  slowing  marketing  spend  on  lead  generation  (note: \\ncompany did state that it has seen an improvement in its opportunity pipeline over the past few weeks), \\nwe  retain  a  cautious  /  prove-it  stance  on  this  momentum-driven  valuation-expansion  story  –  recovery  / \\ngrowth  reacceleration  is  a  F2020  story.  We  think  the  most  notable  takeaways  from  the  Investor  Day \\ninclude:  \\n \\n\\uf0b7  $3B Billings Target Shifted Out by ~6-Mos (No Surprise); ~33% CAGR: Driven by consistent, and \\nwe would assume relatively reasonable historically-based inputs vs. those outlined a year ago, Nutanix \\nprovided a target build-up to a $3B billings level by calendar 2021 (vs. prior F2021; Jul ’21) – reflecting \\nno  big  changes  in  avg.  deal  size  expectations,  repeat  purchase  multiples,  and  customer  expansion \\n(~23,600 by C2021 vs. 12,410 exiting F2Q19).  \\n \\n\\uf0b7  C2021  Target  Model:  Nutanix  outlined  a  C2021  target  model  with  +30%  billings  /  revenue  growth \\n(subscription  at  ~75%  of  rev.  vs.  47%  in  F2Q19),  GM%  at  ~80%,  non-GAAP  EBIT%  at  0%-5%,  and \\nFCF  at  ~10%  of  revenue.  While  we  do  not  currently  model  C2021,  we  would  note  that  we  currently \\nmodel F2021 (Jul ’21) billings at ~$2.2B, revenue at ~$1.9B, GM% at 80.4%, and EBIT% at -11.9%.  \\n \\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC | 29 \\nIT Hardware & Communications Networking \\nEquity Research \\n\\uf0b7  Platform  TAM  /  Monetization  Opportunity  Expansion:  We  think  Nutanix  management  positively \\noutlined  the  company’s  expanding  platform  addressable  market  opportunities  –  Essentials  and \\nEnterprise  solutions  representing  and  incremental  $65B  TAM  opportunity.  The  company  noted  that  it \\ncurrently sees ~90% of its revenue driven by its Core solutions. We continue to believe Nutanix’s ability \\nto  monetize  up  the  stack  will  be  the  next  phase  of  the  company’s  hybrid  /  multi-cloud  platform  story \\n(e.g.,  Xi  Cloud  Services  –  Beam,  Epoch,  Frame,  Leap,  etc.).  We  think  this  would  be  a  key  driver  of \\nvaluation multiple expansion.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7  Sales  Strategy:  Nutanix’s  incoming  Head  of  Americas  Sales,  Chris  Kaddaras,  laid  out  the  company’s \\nstrategy  of  enhancing  the  company’s  sales  force  with  a  focus  on  segmentation  and  building  a \\ndeep/qualified  sales  bench  over  the  next  year.  He  emphasized  his  focus  on  improving  the  company’s \\npipeline  rigor  with  a  goal  of  a  3x  coverage  ratio  with  high  quality  (50%+  per  quarter  conversions). \\nFinally, Mr. Kaddaras said Nutanix is pushing to industrialize a subscription transformation with a focus \\non  customer  subscription  progress  and  strong  refresh  on  end-of-life  device  to  move  to  portable \\nsubscription revenue. He also noted a large pipeline build in EMEA refresh opportunities over the last six \\nmonths. \\n \\nPlease see our detailed report published on 3/20/19 for additional information.  \\n \\nNutanix Job Listings Update \\nNutanix’s job listings totaled 578, up 20 from the prior week and vs. 503 a year ago.  We would note that \\nour conversations with Nutanix suggest that there have been some changes in the way that they list job \\nopenings that has caused the declines in July 2018 rather than any meaningful change in hiring plans. The \\ncompany  currently  has  319  sales  openings,  up  6  from  the  prior  week.  Nutanix  has  125  openings  for \\nengineers, up 5 from the prior week (vs. 118 a year ago), while support listings were up 1 at 32 openings.  \\nAs a reminder, Nutanix reported that it had exited F2Q19 with 4,700 total employees including 2,209 S&M \\nemployees,  up  from  2,102  and  1,606  in  the  prior  and  year-ago  quarters.  The  figure  below  highlights \\nNutanix’s employee job listing trends over the past several years. \\n \\n \\n \\nCommvault \\n \\n \\n(CVLT – $64.80 – Outperform) \\n \\n \\n \\nCommvault Job Listings Update \\nCommvault’s  job  listings  totaled  75,  down  8  from  the  prior  week  and  vs.  64  entering  2019.  Commvault \\nhad  21  sales  openings,  2  openings  in  professional  services,  and  12  openings  in  systems  engineering. \\nThis compares to 26, 2, and 12 openings last week, respectively. Commvault exited the December quarter \\nwith  total  headcount  at  2,576  down  from  2,644  in  the  prior  quarter.  The  company  has  reduced  its \\nheadcount by 9%  since  the  beginning  of  2018  as  part of  its  Commvault  Advance restructuring program. \\nWe think the company’s sales listings could be an important metric to track as Commvault implements a \\ngo-to-market  realignment  –  e.g.,  transitioning  30%-40%  of  its  direct  sales  facing  resources  (+300 \\nemployees) to channel / partnership-facing roles.

       " ('  Strong Semiconductor Outperformance Resulting in Increased Investor Angst Ahead of 1Q19 Earnings Season? With the recent strong performance in semiconductors (SOX +1.3% and +22.1% last week and YTD vs. S&P +1% and +13%, respectively) we have begun to receive increasing investor questions on the set-up into 1Q19 earnings season. On a near-term overall basis, we think some profit taking in semis could materialize as a more cautious stance on 1Q19 earnings season materializes - most investors we have spoken with expect choppy / weak 1Q19 results and cautious 2Q19 outlooks; hope of a materializing 2H2019 recovery remains key focus. That said, we think it is becoming increasingly important to consider company- specific dynamics – we continue to highlight: (1) AMD: Shares rallied last week (+15%) on Google’s Stadia (Project Stream) game streaming announcement confirming the use of AMD’s Radeon GPUs (a 4Q18 driver) and CPUs – implied use of AMD’s 7nm Rome EPYC CPUs considered to be new news. We remain positive on AMD’s positioning for datacenter momentum into mid/2H2019 (note: we think some Rome shipments could commence in 2Q19), coupled with continued broadening PC adoption of AMD’s Ryzen processors through 2019. (2) NVIDIA: NVIDIA shares were up 5.5% this week (+34% YTD) as we continue to see increasing evidence of a completed gaming channel inventory burn-through, coupled positive comments on NVIDIA’s Turing RTX ramp following full product suite availability commencing in late- January. We also remain positive on NVIDIA’s reacceleration of datacenter growth into 2H2019 and the strategic merits / accretion from the company’s acquisition of Mellanox.  Weak South Korea Trade Data: (1) NAND. Exports of NAND Flash on a US$ basis in South Korea declined 41% y/y in Feb.; -34% y/y for Jan + Feb. Unit exports were -8% y/y in Jan + Feb. We estimate total exports down ~40% y/y in 1Q19; units -10% y/y. (2) DRAM. Exports + imports of DRAM declined 33% y/y in Feb.; -27% y/y for Jan + Feb. Unit exports + imports are -22% y/y in Feb; -20% y/y in Jan + Feb. We estimate total exports + imports down ~30% y/y in 1Q19; units down 22% y/y.  Networking Quarterly Review (See Pgs. 7-12): Although backwards looking, we thought we would highlight IDC’s Ethernet Switching quarterly data published this week: (1) The datacenter Ethernet switching market grew 7% y/y to $3.1B in 4Q18; Public Cloud +18.5% y/y (46% of total), while Enterprise was -1% y/y and Service Provider was +3% y/y. (2) 100G Positioning: IDC estimates Arista’s 100G port share at 24% in 4Q18 (flat q/q), compared to Cisco and Juniper at a ~16% and 3% (vs. 19% and 3% in 3Q18). ODM, Accton/EdgeCore continues to have the highest share at 35%. (4) Cisco Campus Momentum: IDC’s data highlights accelerating momentum for Cisco’s campus switching business - +23% y/y in 4Q18, compared to -4%, +6%, -5%, and +8% y/y in 4Q17, 1Q18, 2Q18, and 3Q18 respectively. We remain focused on Cisco’s Catalyst 9k refresh, which was noted as growing double digits y/y in the Jan. ’19 quarter. ',\n",

The researchers reported that when caching was disabled, thus not allowing DRAM to compensate for the comparatively slow Optane, performance performance decreased by 20.1% and 23%, respectively. The study supported Optane’s performance over conventional SSDs and highlighted their potential for large memory footprints currently supplied by DRAM. NextPlatform’s Michael Feldman was more cautious in Optane DC’s potential for in- memory store device replacements, noting that the researchers’ results showed a sensitivity to application type and degrees of software optimization.
