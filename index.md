# About me 

I am Xiangyang Cao, 3rd year PhD student in [Department of Statistics](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/statistics/index.php), [University of South Carolina](https://sc.edu/), advised by [Prof. Karl Gregory](http://people.stat.sc.edu/gregorkb/) and [Prof. Dewei Wang](http://people.stat.sc.edu/wang528/index.html).

Prior to USC, I was an undergrad in mathematics at [Central University of Finance and Economics](http://en.cufe.edu.cn/).

My reseach interest lies in High-dimensional inference and Statistical machine learning. 
I am currently working on:

* A regularization path i.e, LASSO, SCAD, Elastic Net solution path and etc. related method to provide p-values for high-dimensional models.
* A unified framework for calculating variable importance/feature importance for machine learning algorithms involving regularization.


# Publications

* **Cao, X, Gregory, K.B, Wang, D, A generalized framework for high-dimensional inference using Leave-One-Covariate-Out regularization path**, ready to submit.

  - Our procedure allows for calculating variable importance, variable screening/selection and statistical inference. Test statistics constructed by calculating the change in LASSO solution path. P-values are estimated by bootstrapping the null distribution. 
  - We may outperform the [state-of-the-art](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.0518.pdf).
  - R package [**LOCOpath**](https://github.com/statcao/LOCOpath) available. 
  - [A quick demo of our method](./Variable_Importance_using_LOCOPath.html). This demo is coded in Python. 

* **Cao, X, Gregory, K.B, Wang, D, Leave-One-Covariate-Out regularization path on Generalized Linear Models, Cox models and Gaussian Graphical Models**, manuscript in preparation.
  
  - An extension of LOCO regularization path to GLM, cox PH and graphical models.



* **Cao, X, Gregory, K.B, Generalized L1 regularization for Mixture Regression Models**, manuscript in preparation.
  
  - Use generalized LASSO penalty to adaptively control different components of mixture.
