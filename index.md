# About me 

I am Xiangyang Cao, 3rd year PhD student in [Department of Statistics](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/statistics/index.php), [University of South Carolina](https://sc.edu/), advised by [Prof. Karl Gregory](http://people.stat.sc.edu/gregorkb/) and [Prof. Dewei Wang](http://people.stat.sc.edu/wang528/index.html)

My reseach interest lies in High-dimensional inference and Statistical machine learning. 
I am currently working on:

* A path related method to provide p-values for high-dimensional linear models.
* A unified framework for calculating variable importance/feature importance for regularization methods.


# Publications

* Cao, X, Gregory, K.B, Wang, D, A generalized framework for high-dimensional inference using Leave-One-Covariate-Out regularization path, ready to submit.

  - Our procedure allows for calculating variable importance, variable screening/selection and statistical inference. Test statistics constructed by calculating the change in LASSO solution path. P-values are estimated by bootstrapping the null distribution.

* Cao, X, Gregory, K.B, Wang, D, Leave-One-Covariate-Out regularization path on Generalized Linear Models, Cox models and Gaussian Graphical Models, manuscript in preparation.
  - An extension of LOCO regularization path to GLM, cox PH and graphical models.


* Cao, X, Gregory, K.B, Generalized L1$ regularization for Mixture Regression Models, manuscript in preparation.
    - Use generalized LASSO penalty to adaptively control different components of mixture.
